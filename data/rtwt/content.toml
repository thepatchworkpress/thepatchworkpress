Combining Johnston's embroidery work with their other creative interests, The Patchwork Press is a digital scrapbook celebrating mixed-media storytelling, where Johnston shares their evolving interests, ideas and skills. Their writing often concerns gender, capitalism, the Gothic and the reader; you can browse it, if you like. He hopes this particular story finds you well."
