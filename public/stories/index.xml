      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kill the idolater in your head: a poet is a lonely man.&lt;br&gt;
Admire his hand, his turn of phrase, but&lt;br&gt;
do not venerate.&lt;br&gt;
Beautiful words are not water:&lt;br&gt;
they are bullets on your tongue, best served&lt;br&gt;
ripped up, chewed up, spat back out in venom and jest.&lt;br&gt;
Read as a hunter; read as a soldier;&lt;br&gt;
read as a sniper trained on a target.&lt;br&gt;
A poet is not a teacher, though&lt;br&gt;
you must read as a student. You must&lt;br&gt;
read as a businessman and read as the homeless;&lt;br&gt;
read as the housewife, the whore and the faggot â€“&lt;/p&gt;</description>
