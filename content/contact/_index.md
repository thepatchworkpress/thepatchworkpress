# Commissions

I am currently available to commission for embroidery and writing projects. Please email enquiries.patchworkpress@gmail.com if you are interested.

## Rates

The following is a rough price guide for how I price my work, however this is always subject to the needs of your order and the piece(s).

### Applique Patches

Applique designs are priced based on size, plus an additional rate for any additional embroidery.

| Size (cm^2) | Price  |
|-------------|--------|
| < 50        | £12.00 |
| 50 - 100    | £14.00 |
| 100 - 250   | £18.00 |
| > 250       | £20.00 |

The design can be left unbacked and unhemmed for a reduced price.

### Cross-Stitched Patches

Cross-stitched patches are priced based on size, plus an additional fee per letter.

| Size (cm^2) | Price |

### Embroidery, Applique or Darning on a Clothing Item

If you are interested in commissioning an alteration on a clothing item, please email enquiries.patchworkpress@gmail.com to negotiate a quote. You must cover shipping.

### Writing

Minimum 200 words priced at approx. £0.08 per word, subject to the amount of time any additional research needed to write the piece requires. I'm happy to write in any style or form you see on The Patchwork Press, with full credit to Ambrose M Johnston and The Patchwork Press.

### Shipping

If your commission requires shipping, postage will be in addition to the price of the piece.

|         | UK    | International |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Basic   | £1.00 | £2.20         |
| Tracked | £3.30 | £7.20         |

I typically ship with Royal Mail. If you would prefer to pay for an alternative postage provider please let me know!
