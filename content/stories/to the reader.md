Kill the idolater in your head: a poet is a lonely man.  
Admire his hand, his turn of phrase, but  
do not venerate.  
Beautiful words are not water:   
they are bullets on your tongue, best served  
ripped up, chewed up, spat back out in venom and jest.  
Read as a hunter; read as a soldier;  
read as a sniper trained on a target.  
A poet is not a teacher, though  
you must read as a student. You must  
read as a businessman and read as the homeless;  
read as the housewife, the whore and the faggot –  

read, because you are a conversationalist, because  
the pen in your hand won’t move by itself,  
because to read is to write and to write  
is to destroy with  
your power to carve into stone:  
I WAS HERE, AND I FELT!  


Write, because you are the poorest man in the graveyard.  
Write as the worm that will one day feast on your corpse.  

_Written in York Cemetery 22/3/2025_.
