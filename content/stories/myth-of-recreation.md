_‘… but his deviant flesh also undeniably creates new life.’_  
(from _Queer Carnival and Divine Deviance in Lokasenna and Þrymskviða_, Caroline R. Batten)  

Damn my rotten womb, ripe with fruit: let it  
bleed, out, out; let me kill its life anew –  
it means nothing to me. Let me  
rip it from my body  
and cradle it in my arms like  
the bairn it was meant to carry.  
Let me stitch myself up again,  
suddenly whole.  

Damn my womb and the hormones it gives me.  
Damn my breasts and my childbearing curves; damn my  
stabbing, seized-up cunt, slick with blood and lust;  
damn my barren clit – let me   
grow it out into flesh anew. Let me 

grow myself again: let me  
birth Adam in Eden, and  
pluck myself from his rib,  
formed anew in his image;  

let me play God, my own almighty Father;  
remade naked, and to feel no shame.
