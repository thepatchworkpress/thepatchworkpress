# My journey with strings

over the past 10 years, I have endeavoured on a search for the stringiest string. A string so stringy it strings all strings. I have journeyed through the string forests and galloped atop the string steeds. All of which lead me to the string tree atop the string mountain (strountain). It was so stringy. What a string.
