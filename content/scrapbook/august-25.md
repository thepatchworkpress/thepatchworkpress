AH, AUGUST, A MONTH OF reflection, bug bites, and being unbearably sweaty. The month it sunk into me that fuck, I really _have_ graduated uni, now, and scrolling a social media site most believe to be dead, rewatching a sitcom that finished airing before I finished primary school, and complaining about how there are no grad jobs is not a great way to spend my time. I decided to get my act together: I sat down, put my English degree to good use and wrote [a review for _The Passion of New Eve_](https://thepatchworkpress.com/nonfic/new-eve-review/). But where to share my masterpiece? Could it be I should finish setting up that website I started coding way back in March, so that even if I can't achieve my dream of living off an art career, I can at least pretend I gave it a shot?

## Coding

I was very apologetic about the unfinished state of my website in the Instagram post I made about the review, only to become completely obsessed with Hugo and get my home page fixed literally days later. I haven't coded since I was at school, and my computer nerd partner endlessly makes fun of my so-called tech illiteracy, so becoming a GitHub user was not on my 2025 bingo. Hugo is, fortunately for me, fairly straightforward. Mostly, you just type as you would into a text editor, with a few extra underscores here and there. A really irritating quirk is that every theme is coded _slightly_ differently, which is what was tripping me up. I was editing my homepage via an _index.md file under 'content', when, it turns out, my theme, Rusty Typewriter, responds to an entirely different content.yaml file. How I learnt this? The excellent part about Hugo is that you can just scour the GitHub of the person who designed the theme until you get a headache, and you'll probably work something out eventually.

Will I be following in my partner's footsteps and becoming a Linux user? Stay tuned.

## Collaging

Meanwhile, me and my friend made some awesome collages:

I could explain my thoughts behind the piece, but that would ruin the fun. Felt like a proper trans artist making it, anyhow. Really, it makes a lot of sense that there are so many trans collage artists, what with our being drawn to radical acts of recreation from pre-existing parts - although my belief that there are lots of trans collage artists could be confirmation bias.

## The Isle of Wight

I've had a Praktica film camera since 2023, and I got into the habit of taking it pretty much everywhere with me. The main con of this is that I stopped taking pictures on my phone as much, so I have a lot fewer pictures in general, but I can't, really, complain. It feels like I'm living in the moment a lot more when I'm less focused about how something will look on a picture I'm probably not going to look at again, anyway. Film is awesome for preventing that feeling, because you have to put so much more effort into each picture; it makes you appreciate them a lot more.

Unfortunately, my camera broke. It's probably fixable, but the camera already wasn't great, so it's not at the top of my agenda.

On my holiday to the Isle of Wight (in the middle of my Hugo obsession - every night we got back to the place we were staying and I hopped straight on VS Code) I decided I'd take a pen and paper everywhere with me and practise sketching. I love drawing, but since I've always been better at other things, I don't really practise so this seemed like a perfect opportunity.

... I didn't draw very much.

The only quick sketch in a location that I did - which I was pretty pleased with - was this, scribbled while at Yarmouth Castle:


The other drawing I spent the holiday working on I worked from a reference image over hours, and eventually finished later in the month after I'd returned to the frozen north.
