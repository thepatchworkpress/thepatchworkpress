This essay was originally submitted as my final assessment in an undergraduate English Literature module studying Indigenous literatures written in English, originally titled 'Dreams of sick horror and exploding pleasure: Wonder, Eroticism and Destabilising Colonial Hierarchies in Tanya Tagaq’s _Split Tooth_' achieving a 78/100 mark. I wanted to share it because I adored _Split Tooth_ and its wonderfully confusing approach to sexuality, and it would be amazing if there was more noise about it both inside and outside of academia! I have edited it a little since it was marked, adding extra bits of context I had to take out due to word count restrictions, but please bear in mind the original context it was written in!

‘I don’t feel like prey. I too am a predator,’ the protagonist of Tanya Tagaq’s Split Tooth asserts.[^1] This predator/prey hierarchy runs throughout the novel’s depictions of sex and violence, and their relationship to Inuit culture. In _Conquest: Sexual Violence and American Indian Genocide_, Andrea Smith argues that colonialism instituted hierarchy in Indigenous societies, directly linking the hierarchy of patriarchy to the hierarchy of human over land. In the chapter titled ‘Rape of the Land’, Smith writes that ‘the colonial/patriarchal mind that seeks to control the sexuality of women and indigenous peoples also seeks to control nature.’[^2] In order to achieve masculine dominance, the coloniser must subjugate the natural world, and with it, the Indigenous people who have failed to make “use” of its natural resources. Environmental racism, Smith argues, is a form of sexual violence: as the land is ‘violated’ by pollution, so are the bodies of the Indigenous people who live alongside it.[^3] For example, ‘in Nunavut, Inuit mothers’ breast milk has twice the level of dioxin as does women’s breast milk in southern Quebec’.  If the land is “raped”, the Indigenous people who inhabit the land face the same violence.[^4]

_Split Tooth_ subverts colonialism’s “rape of the land”. Confronting systemic sexual abuse against Inuit women and girls alongside a complex portrayal of the agency of the natural world, Tagaq presents the Land as a spiritual body in an erotic relationship with the protagonist; it reclaims its sexual potential from the human that seeks to sexually dominate it by sexually dominating the human. Similarly, in eroticising the Land’s dominance over her, the protagonist resists being a traumatised victim of human sexual violence. Abdenour Bouich argues that the protagonist’s relationship with the Land initiates a ‘path of healing’ from her sexual trauma, ‘constructing and strengthening… her psychological and sexual agency.’[^5] However, this reading of the novel is complicated by the protagonist’s passivity at what the Land dictates upon her body. Although the protagonist consents to when she is impregnated, it is nevertheless an inescapable fate. The colonial hierarchy within which the human dominates the land is destabilised, yet the female, Indigenous body that is dominated alongside the land remains subjugated. Nevertheless, in portraying two sexually subjugated bodies in a mutually erotic relationship, Tagaq subverts the notion that both Indigenous woman and land _must_ be victim. This essay will explore _Split Tooth_ as a text that resists simple categorisation within colonial erotic hierarchy. Although the protagonist engages with the predator/prey colonial hierarchy to achieve dominance among humans, she accepts and eroticises violent dominance of her body by the Land. Although this essay will read all the protagonist’s spiritual encounters with the other-than-human as manifestations of what she terms ‘the Land’, it would be equally plausible to consider the Fox, the polar bear and the Northern Lights as separate entities, a reading which would further illustrate the novel’s erotic complexities.[^6]
