The following essay was originally submitted as my undergraduate dissertation in English Literature, originally titled 'the new skin that had been born... of her bleeding: Purity, Puberty and Rewriting the Sadeian Fairy Tale in Angela Carter's _The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories_', achieving a 70/100 mark. I decided I wanted to share it on my blog because it is my absolute baby: I put my heart and soul into this essay, and I was super happy to get a First on it. It definitely has its flaws; my main piece of feedback, that the second chapter on 'Wolf-Alice' doesn't fit very well with the rest of my argument, is definitely true. However, since the 'Wolf-Alice' chapter was my favourite to write, I've left it in. I hope you enjoy reading it!

## Introduction

Throughout _The Sadeian Woman_, Angela Carter’s controversial analysis of the works of the Marquis de Sade, Carter persistently draws parallels between fairy tales and the way Sade portrays women. Carter writes that Sade’s Justine, alongside ‘her literary granddaughters’, is 

> a beautiful and penniless orphan, the living image of a fairy-tale princess in disguise but a Cinderella for whom the ashes with which she is covered have become part of the skin.[^1]

Sade’s pornography, Carter argues, employs a ‘straitjacket psychology [of vice and virtue that] relates his fiction directly to the black and white ethical world of fairy tale and fable’.[^2] His libertines derive sexual pleasure from degrading the virtuous because to engage in sexual activity at all is, to them and to Sade, to be innately corrupt. Sade’s portrayal of sexuality betrays him to Carter as ‘a great puritan’.[^3] Sarah M. Henstra points to this description as evidence of Carter’s ‘performative reading’ of Sade: ‘Sade would roll in his grave at being called puritanical’.[^4] In this way, _The Sadeian Woman_ shows Carter, not complicit with Sade as many of her contemporaries argued, but ‘actively participating in the construction of meaning as the story unfolds’: Carter ‘rereads’ Sade in order to reframe the underlying ideas that produced his work.[^5]

_The Bloody Chamber and Other Stories_ continues this work, moving Carter’s reading of Sade directly onto the literary fairy tale form. What makes a “fairy tale” is ill-defined. While it has its roots in oral tradition (Carter herself used it in the title of her collection of tales from oral tradition for Virago) by 1979, its origins had been commodified by Perrault, Grimm, and, in the twentieth century, Disney. Perrault repackaged the trope of fairy tales as educational stories told by mothers to their children in his ‘Mother Goose’ tales, appending overt morals to each tale. ‘Bluebeard’, for example, as translated by Carter, declares: 
>Curiosity is the most fleeting of pleasures; the moment it is satisfied, it ceases to exist and it always proves very, very expensive.[^6]
